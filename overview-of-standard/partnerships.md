# Partnerships

## **Partnerships** <a href="#_qrm76cfhw90o" id="_qrm76cfhw90o"></a>

Intrinsic to the core structure of Standard is its ability to incentivize growth through partnerships, interoperability, and integration with other projects. Given the nature and vision of Standard, we see Standard and the SDA token as the center of an entire ecosystem of development. The Standard protocol brings in the most robust assets across all major markets thus solidifying security, trust, and a foundation upon which to build for years to come. These partnerships extend both within the blockchain ecosystem and across traditional and retail markets as we build robust ecosystems for humans to operate collectively.&#x20;

### Business Partners&#x20;

From the outset, Standard has taken a partnership-first approach to building the ecosystem. In the various Standard Economy verticals we are partnering with multiple different businesses to form mutually supportive business relationships.&#x20;

### Standard Protocol and Tech

The core partner on the Standard Protocol and Technology enabling the three core verticals is Solliance. However, we are forming additional specialist partnerships in the Web3 technology and NFTs space.

### Supercharging Digital Assets&#x20;

Partners In our Supercharging Digital Assets Economy vertical, we are currently partnering with communities that sell NFTs, DeFi protocols with structured products to offer, and with NFT marketplaces, and more. The core revenue in this vertical will be from providing technology services to projects on implementing the NUT technology to add utility features to NFTs. This includes NFT creators implementing it into their collection or structured product and services providers seeking to implement NFT technology as a gateway into their product ecosystems.

We have also formed a key strategic partnership with leading Ethereum scaling solution provider Polygon who have an increasing focus on the NFT and Web3 gaming market.

### Scaling Network Effects&#x20;

Partners In our Scaling Network Effects Economy, we are actively partnering with various companies across sectors including political data, media, NFTs, community engagement, and social innovation. communities to build engaged social networks.

### Securing Web3&#x20;

Infrastructure Partners In our Securing Web3 infrastructure Economy we are actively partnering with decentralized validation node providers to power the Distributed Delegation Network so we ensure a diversified distribution of assets across the available decentralized validation service providers.&#x20;

### Advisory Partners&#x20;

Our advisor community is distributed across the globe and includes over 1800 contributors and a growing network of 30+ advisors and partners across a number of sectors from crypto, Web3 and tokenization, to finance and Fin-tech, to sustainable building, and social enterprise.

If you are interested in joining the growing ecosystem, please contact to Build With Us.

## We Love Maxis&#x20;

Maximalism for a certain protocol or technology has gotten a bad rap. It starts when someone goes deep down a rabbit hole researching a technology that connects all the dots and is THE necessary thing to bring forward the fourth industrial revolution. If you’ve gotten this far in the docs, then you probably know exactly what we mean. Standard was not created to compete with other projects in the blockchain space. On the contrary, we too are ‘maxis’ for the best projects with the strongest fundamentals and the greatest network effect so we plan to use these assets as a reserve basis for our treasury. We are also actively forming partnerships with layer one and layer two blockchains, with other DAOs, with NFT communities, and with companies looking to enter the Web3 space with the aim of creating loyal brand communities. Intrinsic to the core structure of Standard is its ability to integrate with and incentivize partnerships with other projects.

### Venture Model <a href="#_gupz557gubq0" id="_gupz557gubq0"></a>

By offering swaps for projects, Standard creates a mechanism to lock that project’s asset in its treasury without the ability to sell it in the future. This creates an intrinsic floor for that asset adding confidence and liquidity, both of which decrease volatility over time. By offering swaps for Standard Assets, we have the ability to bring in some of the largest and most robust communities in the blockchain space from the start. We see this approach as having a network effect, providing a bridge for communities that have traditionally been at odds with each other.

### Standard Venture Partnerships <a href="#_3zbacht8wdme" id="_3zbacht8wdme"></a>

Every entity engaging with Standard in an independent business venture capacity will be required to become a Standard Venture Partner. Venture Partners will be required to submit an application assessing the idea against our criteria to determine if the partner and Standard will be a good fit to support each other's mandates. Areas of interest are based on supporting and aligning with our stated ESG impact mandates (e.g., charitable/public good ventures, asset management, energy, real estate, minerals, and technology).

Allocation of available funds to approved ventures will be determined by a community selection process open to all Standard contributors through a crowdfunding process. Funded mandates will trigger an agreement between Standard and the successful mandate which will allow them to operate as a Standard Venture and leverage the benefits this provides. These benefits will include access to internal expertise from our Houses, and potentially additional matched investment or connection to a pool of impact investors.

The Ventures Agreement sets out the financial relationship of reciprocity between a venture and Standard. This is variable depending on the nature of the venture, location, access to capital, area of operation and other factors. This ensures financial contribution requirements are not overwhelming to ventures and serve to stifle innovation, but also enables Standard to generate revenue for the treasury where ventures are thriving. The venture relationship is a mutually agreed one, and may be ended at any point by either partner, however Standard will incentivize loyalty by offering benefits to long-term partner’s.

### Incubating the Newest Standard Assets <a href="#_u6wfgscmsnqc" id="_u6wfgscmsnqc"></a>

Some Standard Assets will be tokenized assets that are native to and launched first) Standard’s technology and under the Standard brand. SDA is the first example. However we will actively explore potential for other Standard Assets to be launched via the tokenization of real world assets and impact focused projects.

Plenty of asset and impact verticals are ripe for adoption of the Standard model, and use of already existing protocols, but have bottlenecks preventing greater usage (whether that be monetary, skilled labor, vision, partnerships, or a mixture of these and more.)

Standard will lead the process of supporting internal or venture partner projects to launch new assets through this process by connecting them to a growing community of experts, governance and technology to do so.

Successful incubations of Standard Ventures and assets will support not only the incubated protocol, but also SDA holders since a percentage of every venture project incubated will be allocated to the Standard treasury.

### Incentivizing Development to Bring Off-chain Standard Assets On-chain <a href="#_sbybs64y09s4" id="_sbybs64y09s4"></a>

A Standard Digital Asset is defined by the number and diversity of the Standard Assets backing it, however many Standard Assets (e.g., real estate) are still not available to be integrated into Standard’s treasury to provide value to SDA holders. Standard will change this by working to bring off-chain assets like real estate, actual stocks, other precious metals, etc. on-chain to be able to hold in the treasury and potentially even earn yield from.

Standard will bring on industry leaders either into the DAO or as partners to the DAO to help form and execute plans to accomplish these goals. Over time, we expect to see Standard being a backbone for all major industries dedicated to a culture of inclusion, community, and innovation as all incentives will align through Standard.

### NFT Community Partnerships <a href="#_mt31g4bqvd7d" id="_mt31g4bqvd7d"></a>

Standard members will receive a membership NFT that denotes membership in the platform and has gamified utility within the Standard ecosystem. Not only will the NFT enable holders to vote in decisions on the future DAO governance and development, but it will open up potential yield opportunities and discounted services in the DeFi and business services spaces.

We will also extend the ability to mint one of these Standard membership NFTs to strong communities outside of Standard that align with the values and mission of the organization (e.g., ENS domains). This will bring in key industry players as potential partners with vested interest in the success of the project. This collaboration will extend to collaborative mints with partner projects and shared revenues between protocols that will support all protocols and members of such communities involved.
