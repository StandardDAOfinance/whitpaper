# The Standard Solution

The infrastructure of the internet is rapidly being rebuilt using Web3 technology. The new internet infrastructure of Web3 provides all participants economic incentives and rewards to participate in the ecosystem. Standard provides infrastructure to help Investors, Creators, Communities, and Companies unlock this shared value from Web3. We achieve this primarily by focusing on the three core business areas of Supercharging, Scaling, and Securing the 3rd generation of the internet (Web3).

Vertical integration allows us to provide a full-service Web3 product ecosystem powered by the Standard Protocol and dApp and a secure asset-backed treasury. This ecosystem includes blockchain validation and stable yield generation, NFT utility products and services and technology, and tooling for building Web3 enabled Engaged Social Networks focused on organizing niche communities around defined mandates with shared economic value.

Standard’s vertically integrated model creates a regenerative economy that adds value for all participants and compounds network effects to create growth and a thriving ecosystem that ultimately benefits its token holders. Corporations, investors, builders, and ordinary citizens are all uniquely positioned to share in this transformative value creation in partnership with and building upon Standard.

#### Our Vertically integrated model operates in three core areas:&#x20;

## A. Supercharging Digital Assets&#x20;

The Supercharging Assets Economy enables creators, communities and holders to Supercharge their digital assets by combining Web3 technology and social innovation. The Standard Protocol and infrastructure will enable anyone to upgrade the utility of digital and real-world assets. We enable both Web3 creators, and their communities of users to ‘Supercharge’ their NFTs and digital assets.

Supercharging Digital Assets in this context refers to the process of upgrading the real-world utility of digital and real-world assets through Utility NFT technology which unlocks a value and benefits for assets and holders respectively. This enables any real world or digital asset to become a tool for access to a range of additional utility features, and products and services from Standard and partners in the technology ecosystem. Like IOS or Windows, our approach leverages a ‘Master Token’ to provide future-compatibility and upgradeability to digital assets. Each enabled Master Token updates as new functions and interoperability features are created, giving NFT and digital asset holders all the latest utility without needing to buy a new token or integrate with a new protocol.&#x20;

This is primarily a technology provision and business-to-business revenue stream, as we are partnering with leading NFT creators, marketplaces, and companies to add utility to their NFT collections. This product also connects to the Securing Web3 economy as one revenue stream will come from selling Yield-enabled Utility NFTs known as Yield Utility Tokens or YUT. An indicative yield rate is estimated to be between 3-10% APY on all Ethereum being used for this purpose.

## B. Scaling Network Effects&#x20;

The Standard Protocol also enables Standard to decentralize and scale communities by providing membership tokens with utility features, and token-gated community discussion and deliberative Governance tools. We help partners (e.g., corporations, non-profits, individuals) to use Web3 technology and community engagement tools and methods to enhance the capabilities of social networks to mobilize around a cause, mission, or brand.

Standard provides the protocol interface, funding mechanics, communication tools, and access to seed revenue for existing communities and companies to launch their own Web3-enabled ‘Engaged Social Network’ towards a predetermined mandate or outcome. The aim of the network is to discover its own unique way to support its core purpose or mission, add to the public good, and return revenue to the POD members to make it sustainable.

Our Engaged Social Networks enable: Partners to launch blockchain-enabled social networks that can mobilize around a cause or mission. Organizations to increase their customer engagement, operational efficiency, and innovation capabilities through Web3. Nonprofits to multiply funding and community outreach efforts. Creators and Builders to find product market fit and magnify their outreach efforts to scale quicker.

## C. Securing Blockchain Infrastructure&#x20;

Improvements in speed, cost, security, and scalability are causing Web2 applications to migrate to Web3. The rapid growth of Web3 is causing a huge demand for validators to meet the needs of Web2 applications. Network operators earn transaction fees and represent one of Web3’s primary sustainable revenue models.

Standard invests in the adoption of the 3rd generation of the internet by securing the infrastructure of leading blockchains. Network operators (validators) are required to run Web3. We help partners and our community to capture sustainable revenues by enabling fundamental blockchain infrastructure.

Standard’s proprietary Distributed Delegation Network (DDN) is designed to captur- sustainable revenue from Web3. The DDN deploys Standard’s treasury assets toward fundamental infrastructure to Web3 that provides vital resources to network operators. We earn revenue by ‘staking' our treasury assets (e.g. Ethereum) towards token-enabled networks that scale Web3 (e.g., validation, indexing, oracles, storage). This will provide a relatively stable and safe revenue stream for the Standard protocol and its token holders that grows as Web3 scales and increases in adoption.

The ultimate aim of the DDN is to work towards maximal allocation of Standard’s treasury assets prioritizing decentralization of the network and capital efficiency. Within this model, Standard token holders are to stake their tokens to delegate an equivalent amount of Standard’s treasury assets towards operators using a version of the Vesting Escrow (VE) model adopted from Curve Protocol.

This is the base layer in the Standard Ecosystem vertically integrated stack, enabling Standard token holders to benefit through the growth and adoption of Web3.
