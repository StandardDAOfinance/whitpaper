# Partnerships & Roadmap

## **Partnerships**

Intrinsic to the core structure of StandardDAO is its ability to integrate with and incentivise partnerships with other projects. Given the nature and vision of Standard, we see StandardDAO and the SDA token as the center of an entire ecosystem of development. It does this because it is a protocol that brings in the most robust assets across all major markets (eventually) solidifying security, trust, and a foundation for which to build upon for years to come. At the start we see these partnerships growing within the blockchain ecosystem but then expanding across traditional and retail markets.

### We Love Maxis&#x20;

Maximalism for a certain protocol or technology has gotten a bad rap. It starts when someone goes deep down a rabbit hole researching a technology that connects all the dots and is THE necessary thing to bring forward the fourth industrial revolution. If you’ve gotten this far in the docs, then you probably know exactly what we mean. Standard was not created to compete with projects. On the contrary we too are maxis for the best projects with the strongest fundamentals and the greatest network effect. That’s why we created SDA token to be able to bring together all of the strongest communities and figure out how to accelerate the adoption of the best projects in a decentralized ecosystem where all values and economic incentives align. Blockchain is nothing without community and we believe that Standard will have the strongest community in the space.

### Offering Swaps for Other Projects

By offering swaps for projects, StandardDAO creates a mechanism to lock that asset in its treasury without the ability to sell in the future. This creates an intrinsic floor for that asset adding confidence and liquidity, both of which decrease volatility over time. By offering swaps for Standard Assets, we have the ability to bring in some of the largest and most robust communities in the blockchain space from the start. We see this having a network effect providing a bridge for communities that have traditionally been at odds with each other (e.g., Bitcoin maxis v. ETH holders).

### Building Assets and Mechanics to Grow the Treasury

OlympusDAO has done a great job of showing the possibilities of what can be done with a strong community and large budget with a singular goal of growing the network. Building assets such as OlympusPro, wrapped-staked tokens, Olyzaps, and 3,3 Together are perfect examples of ways to accelerate revenues past bond discounts. At StandardDAO, we are not interested in replicating a function that is already available for the sake of competition. Instead we are looking to add to the innovations of OlympusDAO by taking the SDA into greener pastures.&#x20;

The first place that has not yet experienced this sort of innovation is the retail market. One of the goals of StandardDAO is to reduce the complexity of onboarding retail users to the Standard platform. We will also look to build more stabilized yield pools similar to “SMART alpha” offered by BarnBridge. Like other projects we will also seek greater utility for SDA including the ability to wrap and collateralize sSDA and bridge it across chains.

### Incentivizing Development to Bring Off-chain Standard Assets On-chain

A Standard Digital Asset is defined by the number and diversity of the Standard Assets backing it, however many Standard Assets (e.g., real estate) are still not available to be integrated into Standard’s treasury to provide value to SDA holders. StandardDAO will change this by working to bring off-chain assets like real estate, actual stocks, other precious metals, etc. on-chain to be able to hold in the treasury and potentially even earn yield from. Chainlink and its oracle services will be a major partner down the road in this venture as they have been working to do exactly this for years and have made great headway in the real estate and insurance spaces. StandardDAO will bring on industry leaders either into the DAO or as partners to the DAO to help form and execute plans to accomplish these goals. Over time, we expect to see StandardDAO being a backbone for all major industries dedicated to a culture of inclusion, community, and innovation as all incentives will align through Standard.

### Standard Research Group

Being maxis ourselves, we think building a strong fundamental understanding of a protocol or sector is important, but also pretty darn fun. The definition of a Standard Digital Asset was initially created by the founding team. The Standard Research Group will eventually lead the expansion and exploration of not only the definition of a Standard Asset, but also the treasury of Standard Assets held by the protocol.

### Incubating the Newest Standard Assets

The Standard Assets launched first on Standard will by no means be the only Standard Assets out there. Plenty of spaces are ripe for adoption and use of already existing protocols, but have bottlenecks preventing greater usage whether that be monetary, skilled labor, vision, partnerships, or a mixture of these and more. StandardDAO will lead the charge in supporting these projects through a growing community of experts across all walks of life with one common goal in mind. Successful incubations will support not only the incubated protocol, but also SDA holders since a percentage of every project incubated will be allocated to the Standard treasury.

### Regulatory

The regulatory climate in blockchain, especially DeFi, is heating up and we understand that we are by no means immune to what’s coming simply because we are creating a DAO structure. During Standard’s infancy, we will fund partnerships with legal experts already in the blockchain industry to help position the legal structure of StandardDAO in the best way possible for what is looming on the horizon in terms of regulations. As StandardDAO expands we will look to fund initiatives and individuals that are supporting the expansion and development of the blockchain industry worldwide.

## Growth Flywheel

Standard Treasury and StandardDAO both benefit from bonds and ecosystem development. The DAO will work to grow liquidity for $SDA and also build and incubate new applications and protocols on top of and in synergy with Standard. The more the ecosystem grows, the more revenue the Standard Treasury and DAO will receive. As the treasury grows, this also increases the backing for each SDA token, driving value for holders. Eventually, this ecosystem will grow to swallow up all the major Standard Assets across all major verticals providing a robust foundation for the entire ecosystem.
