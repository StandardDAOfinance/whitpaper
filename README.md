### **The Problem** <a href="#_9f1lvxbmxet" id="_9f1lvxbmxet"></a>

Traditional investment tools are designed with only one goal in mind - to make the rich richer - often neglecting long term effects this has on people and the environment. Examples of the negative impacts include Mortgage Backed Securities and the 2008 financial crisis, or the mining industry’s exploitation of labor and environmental harms. These result in a concentration of wealth in the hands of a few and the exploitation of common resources or ‘public goods’ that communities rely on (both social and ecological). This situation leaves communities with little access to capital to enable them to improve their economic situation and enhance public goods and their natural surroundings through innovation.

The newer generations need to take control of the economy and make decisions that will have an impact on their lives, however they are deprived of efficient means to do so. We believe that providing the right tools and access to finance to the next generation of investors is vital to creating a foundation for economic growth and reducing inequality.

### **The Need for Innovation** <a href="#_mjnt2p6tehrl" id="_mjnt2p6tehrl"></a>

New technological innovation provides us many opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies across all aspects of our society, economy and environment. Advances in sustainable construction, renewable energy and blockchain technology present a generational opportunity to solve major problems we face. However innovation is still required in the financing and scaling of such innovative efforts globally, as well as in the coordination of capital into collaborative efforts aimed at achieving this purpose.

Traditional investment models prioritize profit over everything else - often leading to unethical solutions that steer towards economic and environmental damage in the long run. Company executives working in large corporate environments in this field are forced to push profits constantly because their revenue determines their market worth. Startups are generally also shaped by this dynamic, meaning the traditional VC system incentivizes shareholder value creation above the potential social, environmental and public good impacts projects stand to create.

The opposite of a traditional profit-focused entity is a crowdfunding project. This approach allows for more freedom and choice of goals for everyone involved, but fails to provide long-term incentives for the participants and donors. The lack of long-term incentives is a serious drawback that makes it unsuitable for large-scale investment projects, such as developing new infrastructure.

We recognize that communities can create impact investment funds independently, but these efforts often end up as one-time projects and involve expenses and risk management requirements that make it infeasible for most projects. Successful investments require constant operation and reliable backing, which most community raised investments lack. Additionally, people in developing countries can take on their own investment projects to strengthen their communities, however they may lack the necessary specialists or financial infrastructure to achieve stable performance.

### **The Solution** <a href="#_qdbxubg35p6j" id="_qdbxubg35p6j"></a>

#### **What do we provide?**

Standard offers accessible financial tools worldwide that allow people to invest in meaningful projects that provide a number of benefits for local communities via the assets taken in. For example projects funded to build sustainable housing, infrastructure or technology will be able to tokenize and ‘bond’ these assets in the Standard treasury so they are serving as a public good held by/and for the benefit of all Standard members.

Standard offers access to funding within a supportive DAO model that enables recipients to remain as long-term members of a thriving collaborative network of funders, other ventures and subject area experts. This brings the donor community and recipients together in a long term, mutually beneficial partnership to achieve the stated impact goals.

#### **Value derivation?**

The Standard treasury will hold real-world assets (e.g., gold, real estate, energy) and well-established digital assets (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, Chainlink), in order to provide a real and tangible value backing to SDA tokens. These assets were chosen because they are proven to be resilient and fundamental to the evolving digital ecosystem. The technological backbone of the application of Standard also has advanced financial security features that leverage both financial investment expertise and AI technology to manage the assets and prevent loss of value due to intrinsic market volatility.

#### **How do we differentiate?**

What differentiates Standard from other investment-related startups is that we are incorporating as a DAO and embracing the web 3 mindset of collective effort towards common goals. This fundamentally shifts away from the traditional investment model focused solely on producing profits for shareholders. The DAO model enables communities to be integrated with the process of the proposal, decision, and investment in the overall mandate. A DAO model also means governance is on-chain and immutable, and transparent to investors and members. We believe that this creates a foundation for a more even distribution of wealth, resources, and stable economic growth as a community. Unlike traditional impact investing, which requires the contribution of a large sum of money, anyone (with any amount of money) can participate in funding an investment that makes a successful, long-term impact with Standard.

#### **Why blockchain?**

Stability and security are a cornerstone for the Standard philosophy of bringing together the best of crypto and traditional financial investment models. Standard uses a combination of decentralized networking and a diversified treasury that includes ‘blue-chip’ infrastructure-based cryptocurrency and real-world assets to offer access to participants worldwide and protect the investments from volatility.

Blockchain enables the innovative approach of Standard of ‘tokenizing’ real assets and impact goals so that their value can be incorporated into the DAO treasury. Doing this securely and efficiently is facilitated by smart contracts, whereas it would have been extremely challenging to achieve just a few years ago without this technology.

Blockchain also enables Standard to operate collectively as a collaborative funding ecosystem using web 3 technology, and enables us to reach a larger scale more efficiently without compromising on security. This enables efficient and immutable governance and transparency internally and externally. The DAO model is an effective way to tap into the collective human capacity of the network and to ensure those creating the value of Standard as users are able to share in the benefits of the growth of the network.

## **The Standard Purpose** <a href="#_gws785zkwap" id="_gws785zkwap"></a>

We believe that innovative financial technology and web 3 collaborative coordination processes must be used to benefit and empower communities to make decisions that will impact their lives. Standard is creating a community-driven crypto investment ecosystem that aligns incentives for people, planet, and profit.

Standard is building the foundations for the project with these key features:

1. An open community led investment initiative supporting funding for initiatives that support positive ecological and social impacts and decentralized governance.
2. A community of individuals whose purpose is to identify and provide transparency and validation for Standard Assets in and out of blockchain, providing clarity for less crypto native users and stability to the space for years to come.
3. A treasury of both tokenized real world and digital ‘Standard Assets’ (e.g., Gold, Real Estate, Energy, and Technology)

Standard will utilize a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the SDA token is controlled at a high level by financial experts in the Standard team in consultation with the community of users.

In the long term, this system will be used to optimize for economic stability and function as a global store of value underscored by a purpose of investing to positively impact people's lives. In the short term, we seek to rapidly grow the Standard ecosystem and the production of real impacts. This is being done in order to sustainably increase the value of the treasury and provide stabilized yields for both crypto and non-crypto native users of the services we provide. We are targeting sustainable and organic growth rather than a ‘pump-and-dump’, and our asset backing is designed to ensure the system does not require massive exponential user growth simply in order to maintain its token price.
