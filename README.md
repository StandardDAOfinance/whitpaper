# Introduction

## Introduction To Standard

Standard DAO is a globally distributed collection of citizens, investors, and builders - we are building a stable community treasury holding a diverse pool of digital and real-world assets represented on-chain by our native SDA token. Standard is the first treasury-backed protocol that earns sustainable revenues from the growth and adoption of Web3 with the aim of creating an environment where community-driven economic and social impact will thrive. The Standard treasury holds the value of both digital and real-world assets, as well as the revenue of all economic initiatives within the Standard Ecosystem.

We help Investors, Creators, Communities, and Companies unlock value from Web3. We do this primarily through three business units focused on supercharging, scaling, and securing the 3rd generation of the internet (Web3).

Assets held in the Standard treasury are Standard Assets, built on the fundamental principles of the Standard Digital Asset framework. Assets held by Standard are put to work in unique ways to serve the fundamental growth and development of both the Standard Economic engine and communities globally.

## The Problem&#x20;

The 3rd generation of the internet (Web3) is a way to describe the growth and adoption of blockchain technology as it becomes embedded into everything that we do. Web2 was largely built on a rent-based model where Web2 companies own and sell user data. The new iteration of the internet, also sometimes referred to as Web3, is Open, Trustless, and Distributed creating an environment where all may benefit. In Web3, users own (and optionally sell) their data creating the first ownership based internet model. Value from interactions can now be shared between users, creators, platforms, and investors - enabling greater incentives for participation in the internet economy.

Standardization in digital infrastructure enabled the growth and adoption of Web2 (the early internet). However, existing internet infrastructure (Web2) lacks the ability to reward participants for the value each party brings to the ecosystem. Web3 provides the solution to this, however lacks standardized infrastructure that would enable greater usage and adoption of blockchain technology globally. 1.2 The Need for Innovation In addition, traditional investment tools are designed with only one goal in mind - to make the rich richer - often neglecting long term effects on the economy and ultimately people. We believe that providing the right tools and access to finance to the next generation of builders and investors is vital to creating a foundation for economic growth and innovation globally.

New technological innovation provides us many opportunities to achieve greater efficiencies across all aspects of our society, economy and environment. Advances in sustainable construction, renewable energy and blockchain technology present a generational opportunity to solve major problems we face. However novel solutions are still required in the financing and scaling of such efforts globally, as well as in the coordination of capital from a variety of groups of individuals and syndicates aimed at achieving this purpose.

Traditional investment models prioritize profit over everything else - are often exclusive to the ultra wealthy and often fail to take into account the needs of a more global population. Direct community investments provide a solution to traditional investment models as a targeted funding method towards a cause or issue, however these efforts often end up as one-time projects as they often lack consistent operational and funding support.

Companies have also taken a step in this direction by providing greater opportunities for initiative and autonomy by their employees and more engagement with their customers in their direction. However, this shift requires the traditional corporation to adopt a more dynamic model that requires robust technical and operational tools. This is the core problem Standard is seeking to address by providing the tools and knowledge to enable partners to invest in bringing their communities into the creative and economic process.

## **The Opportunity**

Web2 has shown 50x growth over the past 45 years and blockchain is starting down a similar trajectory. This chart shows the Nasdaq with the invention times of various protocol applications that enabled the growth of web technology.

New Web3 technology and social innovation approaches enable us to achieve greater efficiencies across all aspects of our society, economy and environments. Advances in blockchain technology and community coordination (oftentimes associated with Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAO) structures that enable more inclusive and dynamic organizational structure present a generational opportunity to solve major problems. However innovation is still required in the financing and scaling of such innovative efforts globally, as well as in the coordination of capital into collaborative efforts aimed at achieving this purpose.

In the same way as internet adoption, the development of core blockchain infrastructure that enables applications to operate on Web3 has contributed to the growth of blockchain user adoption over time. The rapid growth in infrastructure and tooling has enabled exponentially increasing opportunities for citizens and organizations alike to participate in building this new internet and be rewarded financially in the process.



## DAO Structure

Standard DAO is operating as a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO). The core mission of the company is to manage the Standard protocol and the native token SDA, and to return revenue to investors. All equity investors in the SDA token will have the opportunity to have a voice in the governance of the company and protocol.

**Standard DAO is designed from the ground up to include the following core features:**

&#x20;The Standard Economy Ecosystem

1. The Standard Treasury with Secure treasury management;&#x20;
2. The native token - Standard Digital Asset (SDA);&#x20;
3.  The Standard Protocol - A secure technology infrastructure layer;&#x20;

    and A Deliberative Governance structure.&#x20;

### Why a DAO?&#x20;

The DAO framework provides us with a new and uniquely transformative ability to scale and include communities in the mission of an organization. As Anthony Cabraal of Better Work Together says, “effective decentralized organizations can work together as a system, as a platform for collective ambition”. This is done by enabling the following elements:

1. A shared mission - One that everyone is on board with and can be understood easily.
2. A group of high-agency people - Independent, autonomous people galvanized together by a shared sense of purpose and identity.
3. Support to build ventures - By actively encouraging initiative, the collective capacity of the group to solve problems, grow together and create impact dramatically increases.
4. A central structural and finance commons - a transparent, well organized entity that manages common assets, brand identity, collects and redistributes common resources and interfaces with the legal world.
5. Space for relationships and weaving social fabric. This fabric of community, connection and belonging is hard to measure and often invisible but it is fundamentally critical. Trust is a secret weapon.

We are bringing all of these elements together in a seamless package powered by the Standard Protocol. The Protocol provides the tools for both Standard and our partners to include community members in more meaningful ways in driving a collective mission.
