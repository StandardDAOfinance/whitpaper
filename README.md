| Network Utility Token (NUT )  | Proprietary NFT that connects to sources of utility to existing NFTs (e.g., PFPs, ID tokens) enabling NFT holders today to "Supercharge" or "Boost" the underlying value or utility of their NFT. Things that could be added to the NUT would include revenue streams, forms of membership, and other Utility types. We expect this to create a Utility marketplace that NFT holders and creators participate in to boost the value of traditional NFTs.                        |
| Yield Utility Token (YUT)     | Proprietary NFT that connects to sources of revenue that accrue to a pool claimable by users through connection under the NUT. The Yield Utility Token can be bought and sold on the secondary market but is not exchangeable for assets in the Standard Treasury. Sustainable revenues will accrue in perpetuity as long the transaction fees are occurring on the networks being validated. A Yield Utility Token is a non-equity, non-voting class of revenue bearing asset. |
| SDA Token (SDA)               | Equity in Standard DAO will be designated through holdings of SDA tokens. These tokens will provide holders with the ability to vote on governance over the treasury and protocol if staked.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
