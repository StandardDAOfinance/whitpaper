# Introduction

## What is Standard?&#x20;

Standard is the first diversified, decentralized treasury that holds [Standard Assets](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#standard-asset-sa), represented by a [Standard Digital Asset](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#standard-digital-asset-sda) ($SDA token). SDA token is the first Standard Digital Asset to provide asset backed yields to its holders. Each SDA token is backed by a basket of assets which have been identified as Standard Assets in their given vertical (e.g., Gold, BTC, ETH, LINK). Standard assets are defined by three key features:

1. An asset that has proven it is “Too Big to Fail” by showing staying power through bull and bear cycles.
2. Top asset in a given vertical by utility and/or marketcap.
3. Shows consistent growth and adoption over time.

### Going Off the Gold Standard

In August 15, 1971, President Richard Nixon took the US dollar off the “Gold Standard” with the intent of “...protect(ing) the position of the American dollar as a pillar of monetary stability around the world…”. Since then we have seen the value of the dollar plunge at an exponential rate compared to previous decades with unforeseen social and financial crises correlated to this event.

### Bringing Back the Gold Standard (and more)

Enter Standard...an effort to bring real value back to currency by holding both real world and blockchain standard assets in its treasury. Standard builds upon unique economic and [game-theory](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/4-4-and-history-of-3-3-and-1-1) dynamics using staking and swapping initially released and brought to market by [OlympusDAO](http://olympusdao.finance).&#x20;

## What is the point of Standard? <a href="#_ujzylohvndx7" id="_ujzylohvndx7"></a>

Standard is building upon the fundamentals and code of Olympus with a few key distinctions: 1) building a treasury of Standard Assets, 2) adding real assets to the treasury (e.g., Gold), 3) building a community of individuals whose purpose is to identify and provide transparency and validation for Standard Assets in and out of blockchain, providing clarity for less crypto native users and stability to the space, for years to come (i.e., [Standard Research Group](https://docs.standarddao.finance/partnerships-and-roadmap#standard-research-group)).

### Goals of Standard&#x20;

* Build a robust and diversified treasury backed by a diversified basket of standard assets providing stability over boom and bust cycles.
* Provide stability to its partners and all asset types across verticals in and out of the blockchain space.
* Identify, acquire, and incubate standard assets across all verticals.

Just like Olympus, Standard will utilize a policy-controlled currency system, in which the behavior of the SDA token is controlled at a high level by the [DAO](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#dao).

In the long term, we believe this system will be used to optimize for economic stability and as a global store of value. In the short term we seek to rapidly grow the Standard ecosystem to drive up the value and also provide stabilized yields for both crypto and non-crypto native users.&#x20;

## How do I participate in Standard? <a href="#_rkdk3xtenib3" id="_rkdk3xtenib3"></a>

There are two main strategies for market participants: staking and swapping. Stakers stake their SDA tokens in return for more SDA tokens, while swappers exchange their assets (e.g., PAXG, DAI, PAXG-SDA) in exchange for SDA tokens after a fixed vesting period.

### Staking <a href="#_p8x8xetz01fc" id="_p8x8xetz01fc"></a>

The main benefit for stakers comes from supply growth. The protocol mints new SDA tokens from the treasury, the majority of which are distributed to the stakers. Thus, the gain for stakers will come from their auto-compounding balances, though price exposure remains an important consideration. That is, if the increase in token balance outpaces the potential drop in price (due to inflation), stakers would make a profit.

### Swapping <a href="#_88ynkywv1285" id="_88ynkywv1285"></a>

The main benefit for swappers comes from price consistency. Swappers commit capital upfront based on a promised a fixed return after \~5 days in SDA tokens. Over this time, 20% of the swap reward is released each day and automatically staked for the swapper adding a compound factor to the initial yield received. That means the swapper's profit would depend on SDA price and staking [APR ](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#apr)over the duration of swap maturity. Swappers benefit by either a _rising_ or _static_ SDA price.
