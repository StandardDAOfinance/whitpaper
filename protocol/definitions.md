### APR&#x20;

Annual Percentage Rate, is the annualized interest rate without taking the effect of compounding into account.&#x20;

### APY&#x20;

Annual Percentage Yield, is the normalized representation of an interest rate, based on a compounding period over one year. Note that APYs provided are rather ballpark level indicators and not so much precise future results.&#x20;

### Asset Backed Cryptocurrency&#x20;

A cryptocurrency backed by and transferable for a real world asset (e.g., gold, dollars, real estate)&#x20;

### Cryptocurrency

Any form of currency that only exists digitally, that usually has no central issuing or regulating authority but instead uses a decentralized system to record transactions and manage the issuance of new units, and that relies on cryptography to prevent counterfeiting and fraudulent transactions. (https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cryptocurrency)&#x20;

### DAO&#x20;

Decentralized Autonomous Organization, is a governance mechanism for making decisions in a more trustless and collaborative way. Voting rights are often bound to a governance token. In StandardDAO the governance token is sSDA.&#x20;

### DCV&#x20;

Deflation Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which protocol defined buy pressure changes. A higher DCV means more buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a higher deflation. A lower DCV means less buy pressure from the protocol, resulting in a lower deflation.&#x20;

### Decentralized Application (dApp)&#x20;

A decentralized application (dApp) is a digital app employing blockchain technology to keep users’ data out of the hands of the organizations behind it. The blockchain stores copies of its expanding stack of data on “nodes” owned by users, rather than by the creators of the dApp.

### Liquidity Swaps&#x20;

Liquidity swaps are LP token swaps. Examples are SDA-ETH LP swaps and SDA-DAI LP swaps.&#x20;

### PCV&#x20;

Protocol Controlled Value, is the amount of funds the treasury owns and controls. The more PCV the better for the protocol and its users.&#x20;

### POL&#x20;

Protocol Owned Liquidity, is the amount of LP the treasury owns and controls. The more POL the better for the protocol and its users.&#x20;

### PoR&#x20;

Proof of Reserve, is the mechanism of strengthening the reserve of StandardDAO treasury via the sales of swaps. Swappers provide liquidity to the treasury, thereby building its reserve. In return for their service, swappers get paid in SDA.&#x20;

### Reserve Swaps&#x20;

Reserve swaps are single asset swaps. Examples are DAI swaps and PAXG swaps.&#x20;

### Reward Rate&#x20;

Reward rate is the configured percentage of SDA distributed to all stakers on each rebase relative to the total supply. The reward rate is precisely set by the policy team.&#x20;

### Reward Yield&#x20;

Reward yield refers to the actual amount of SDA received by each staker on each rebase. The reward yield is a rough target from a policy point of view. It can almost never be maintained precisely due to e.g. fluctuating amounts of SDA staked.&#x20;

### Runway

The amount of time the protocol could sustain the current staking reward rate if no new swaps were taken in (i.e., if rewards were paid out through the value of the treasury).

### SDA Backing&#x20;

Is the amount of funds in the treasury backing SDA.&#x20;

### SCV&#x20;

Swap Control Variable, is the scaling factor at which swap prices change. A higher SCV means a lower discount for swappers and higher inflation by the protocol. A lower SCV means a higher discount for swappers and lower inflation by the protocol.&#x20;

### Standard Asset (SA)&#x20;

An asset in any industry that incorporates the follow principles: An asset that has proven it is “Too Big to Fail” by showing staying power through bull and bear cycles. Top asset in a given vertical by utility and/or marketcap. Shows consistent growth and adoption over time.

### Standard Digital Asset (SDA)

A token backed by a diversified, decentralized treasury of Standard Assets.



### The Standard Protocol&#x20;

The Standard Protocol is a technology layer that enables users to interact with the Standard Economy Ecosystem, Standard Assets, and Standard DAO governance. The protocol features a dApp and a user interface allowing various actions such as swapping to and from and staking SDA, or interacting with Supercharged NFTs. It also features the Standard Protocol Governance system and ways to interact with Product Governance within the Standard Economy Ecosystem.&#x20;

### TVL&#x20;

Total Value Locked, is the dollar amount of all SDA staked in the protocol. This metric is often used as growth or health indicator in DeFi projects.&#x20;

### Network Utility Token (NUT )&#x20;

Proprietary NFT that connects to sources of utility to existing NFTs (e.g., PFPs, ID tokens) enabling NFT holders today to "Supercharge" or "Boost" the underlying value or utility of their NFT. Things that could be added to the NUT would include revenue streams, forms of membership, and other Utility types. We expect this to create a Utility marketplace that NFT holders and creators participate in to boost the value of traditional NFTs.&#x20;

### Yield Utility Token (YUT)&#x20;

Proprietary NFT that connects to sources of revenue that accrue to a pool claimable by users through connection under the NUT. The Yield Utility Token can be bought and sold on the secondary market but is not exchangeable for assets in the Standard Treasury. Sustainable revenues will accrue in perpetuity as long the transaction fees are occurring on the networks being validated. A Yield Utility Token is a non-equity, non-voting class of revenue bearing asset.

### SDA Token (SDA)

\
Equity in Standard DAO will be designated through holdings of SDA tokens. These tokens will provide holders with the ability to vote on governance over the treasury and protocol if staked.&#x20;

### Staked SDA (sSDA)&#x20;

Staking SDA tokens unlocks governance ability over the protocol and treasury assets. In order to stake, a user must lock up their SDA tokens into a smart contract in exchange for a staked representation of SDA. Stakers will have the ability to lock up their tokens for a predefined period of time providing a greater say over the delegation of assets to workers in an economy (e.g., validators in the validator economy).&#x20;

### Mint Fee&#x20;

A small fee will be charged for every non-fungible token (NUT/YUT) that a user purchases (mint's). This fee will flow back to the Standard Treasury in order to maintain sustainable yield flows to holders.&#x20;

### Partnership Fee&#x20;

Developers and partners who wish to integrate the revenue mechanic into their NUT will be able to do so in a marketplace of structured products which will enable fee share to Standard Treasury upon sale.&#x20;

### Royalty Fee&#x20;

Each Utility Token minted will have a % royalty fee built in which will go to Standard Treasury triggered at every sale.&#x20;

### Standard Protocol Governance&#x20;

Governance over core protocol and Standard Treasury decisions (only accessible by SDA equity holders.) SDA token holders will have one transferable vote which they will be able to delegate to a representative or use themselves. The governance system will be built to optimize security, transparency, and ultimately benefit the protocol and all of its users.&#x20;

### Standard Validation Network (SVN)&#x20;

The Standard Validation Network is a pool of validators who qualify based on a set of criteria and KPIs. Onboarding to the program is done through an automated assessment and a manual qualification of the business model to make sure of sufficient decentralization, quality, and independence from other validator teams.&#x20;

### Delegation&#x20;

Delegation of assets to validators/nodes will be based on two mechanics. First, all delegators in the Standard Validation Network will receive a base amount of assets to perform staking services. These assets will be increased or decreased depending on an algorithmic formula tracking a number of KPIs including but not limited to the uptime, yield, and security of each validator. The second way a validator will be able to receive assets will be based on the delegation of Gov points from SDA stakers. This system will be specifically curated so all Standard DAO assets will be diversified and no validator holds greater than 25% of the total ETH in the network, essentially providing each validator an "eligible surplus" amount that could be delegated whether or not it is. The vision of delegating in this way is to create a DDN that will make sure that 100% deployment of ETH is to validators from a centralized pool of liquidity while supporting optimal decentralization over the network.&#x20;

### Distributed Delegation Network (DDN)&#x20;

A centralized pool of assets is controlled by a distributed pool of participants controlling the flow of assets to revenue bearing functions. In the staking economy, the utility of the DDN is to ensure optimal deployment of assets, limiting security and staking risk, all while maintaining a diversified distribution of asset delegation.

### Governance Points&#x20;

Governance (Gov) Points are unlocked for SDA holders when they stake their SDA tokens. These points are able to be allocated to specific validators within the Standard Validation Network based on their choosing. Gov points will be calculated based on the amount of SDA staked x the length of time SDA is staked. For example, a user who holds 1 SDA and stakes for 5 years will receive the same amount of Gov points as a user who holds 5 SDA and stakes for 1 year.&#x20;

### The Standard Economy Ecosystem&#x20;

An ecosystem managed by Standard featuring multiple economic verticals focused on three core areas of Supercharging Digital Assets, Securing Blockchain Infrastructure, and Scaling engaged social network communities.&#x20;

###

### Standard Product Governance&#x20;

Governance over non-core protocol decisions related to participation in decentralized economies within the Standard Ecosystem (accessible by those not holding SDA tokens on a case by case basis for each product within the Economy Ecosystem according to stated terms of the product.)&#x20;

### Standard Product&#x20;

A product launched within any of the Standard Economies within the Economy Ecosystem&#x20;

### Validation Treasury&#x20;

A separate ring-fenced treasury for assets raised for the express purpose of validating the blockchain network. Economy Treasury A separate ring-fenced treasury for assets raised for the express purpose of use in any other Standard Economy within the Ecosystem

### Vesting Escrow (VE)

Initially created by the Curve Finance team, the voting escrow function enables governance token holders to unlock greater voting capabilities the longer they choose to lock up their tokens.
