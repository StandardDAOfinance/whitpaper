# 4,4 and History of 3,3 and 1,1

## History of 3,3 and 1,1&#x20;

These terms were derived from a game theory model developed by OlympusDAO to determine the positive and negative outcomes of two investors given 3 choices:

1. Stake (Buy)&#x20;
2. Bond (Swap)
3. Sell&#x20;

When an investor anticipates an increase in supply or in price, they tend to stake. When they feel that the price is going to drop, they generally sell. When an investor does not think that the price will drop significantly in a given time period, they will usually bond to buy at a discounted rate.

If all investors buy and then stake, the price will always be going up, which is a win win for everybody involved. If all investors decide to sell, no one will want to stake and buy, leading to a significant price decrease; a lose lose for all people involved. Lastly, If everyone bonds it’s the lowest performing positive outcome (1,1).

The best strategy here is for each investor to stake (3,3).

This theory shows that working together forms the best possible outcome for both parties.

## A New Frontier with Auto-staked Swaps

Now that you understand the basics of 3,3 and 1,1 - let’s dive into the basics of 4,4.

4,4 is a way to “beat” 3,3. Think of 4,4 as a higher number than the latter, so it gives a higher return on the investors money.

In 3,3, a person buys a bond and is rewarded in SDA. They can claim their SDA whenever they want, as long as the portion they want to claim has been vested for the required period of time. Once claimed, they can then stake it, turning it into sSDA (Staked SDA).

In 4,4, a person still buys a bond, but is rewarded in sSDA. This means that regardless of when they claim their bonds and what they choose to do with it, their money is automatically being staked from the moment of purchase after each epoch. This concept is a slight deviation of 3,3, but greatly increases the yield optimization the investor gets.

### Here’s a visual to help understand:

#### 3,3 - Staking

Investor buys SDA off the market → investor stakes SDA in protocol receiving sSDA → earns compounded interest each epoch

#### 4,4 - Bonding + Staking

Investor buys swap to receive SDA at a discount after 5 days → after each epoch, a portion of the position is staked until it is claimable on day 5 → earn discounted SDA + extra yield earned from auto staking

ROI and OHM growth comparison over 15 Epochs:

As shown in the figures, 4,4 yields a 7.84% ROI, while 3,3 outputs 6.02%. The OHM growth for 4,4, gives you 3.35 more OHM over 15 epochs.

The beauty of 4,4, is that your swaps are automatically staked. Users no longer have to claim their SDA everyday and then stake it. 4,4 will do it automatically for you saving potentially hundreds on ETH gas fees.
