# Standard Protocol and Technology Stack

## Standard Protocol

The Standard Protocol is a technology layer that enables users to interact with the Standard Economy Ecosystem, Standard Assets, and Standard DAO governance. The protocol features a dApp and a user interface allowing various actions such as swapping to and from and staking SDA, or interacting with Supercharged NFTs. It also features the Standard Protocol Governance system and ways to interact with Product Governance within the Standard Economy Ecosystem.

**The core design criteria of the Standard protocol are:**

1. Cloud security,&#x20;
2. automation and systems integration;&#x20;
3. A robust, secure, globally distributed framework;&#x20;
4. A permissionless, interoperable, system with distributed ownership&#x20;

Stability and security are cornerstones of the Standard philosophy of bringing together the best of crypto and traditional financial investment and community organization models. Standard uses a combination of decentralized networking and a diversified treasury that includes ‘blue-chip’ infrastructure-based cryptocurrency and real-world assets to offer access to participants worldwide and protect the investments from volatility while empowering members and communities to thrive.

## Why Blockchain?&#x20;

An ecosystem based on blockchain protocols allows Standard to achieve the above criteria and offers the following advantages over a traditional organization:&#x20;

* Shareholders are directly connected to the business activities and impact through a unified ledger creating greater efficiency to unlock value.&#x20;
* All activities are public and transparent while a traditional corporate policy would restrict access to vital information even for shareholders.&#x20;
* Investment mandates are made by communities in their interests instead of decisions made by a few top-level executives. &#x20;
* Low operation costs compared to a traditional model.&#x20;
* Access for everyone who wants to participate instead of an ‘invite only’ model.
* Ability to operate worldwide.&#x20;

Blockchain enables the automated onboarding of real assets through ‘tokenization’ so that their value can be incorporated into the Standard Treasury. Doing this securely and efficiently is facilitated by smart contracts, whereas it would have been extremely challenging to achieve just a few years ago without this technology.

Blockchain also enables Standard to operate collectively as a collaborative funding ecosystem using Web3 technology and enables us to reach a larger scale more efficiently without compromising on security. This enables efficient and immutable governance and transparency internally and externally. The DAO model is an effective way to tap into the collective human capacity of the network and to ensure those creating the value of Standard as users are able to share in the benefits of the growth of the network.

## Security/Auditing&#x20;

All smart contracts deployed by Standard are audited by numerous third-party companies (e.g., CertiK, Open Zepplin, Hacken). These audits are listed in the documents on our website. We also have an in-house audit practice and scanner as well as bug bounty campaigns going 24/7 to ensure maximum security for our investors.

## Expert Technology Team

The success of the Standard Ecosystem requires data infrastructure, technology expertise, and a decentralized network of participants. Standard has a team of experts in Web2 & Web3 to build the utility and interoperability infrastructure required to run the Standard Protocol. We understand the infrastructure of validating and cloud hosting arguably more than any other market players. In order to have security around potentially billions of dollars being staked in this infrastructure and in our DDN validating leading blockchain networks, it was critical that this protocol build is founded on certainty and security from the core.
