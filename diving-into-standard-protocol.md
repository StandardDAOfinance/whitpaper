# Diving into Standard Protocol

## What is Swapping?&#x20;

Swapping is the secondary value accrual strategy of Standard. It allows Standard to acquire its own [liquidity](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#liquidity-swaps) and other [reserve assets](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#reserve-swaps) such as DAI or PAXG by selling SDA tokens at a discount in exchange for these assets. The protocol quotes the swapper with terms such as the swap price, the amount of SDA tokens entitled to the swapper, and the vesting term. A portion of the swappers tokens will be staked each day over the vesting period and at the end of the term, the full amount will be claimable as sSDA. The combination of swapping and staking compounds rewards for swappers enabling higher yields.

Swapping is an active, short-term strategy based on the discount the protocol is providing to the market on any one swap. Users swapping their assets for sSDA may run the risk of a drop in the market value of the redeemable sSDA at the end of the 5 day period. This makes swapping a more active investment strategy that has to be monitored constantly in order to be more profitable as compared to staking only.

Swapping allows Standard to accumulate its own [PCV ](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#pcv)through liquidity and reserve assets. We call our own liquidity [POL](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#pol). POL ensures a market for exit liquidity to ensure trading and market operations while also protecting holders. Since Standard owns its own liquidity, it also receives fees earned from open market trades through the pairs held by the treasury. This adds another revenue stream for the protocol to bolster the underlying value of SDA.

## What is Staking?

Staking is one of the primary yield strategies for SDA holders. Stakers are able to stake buy either purchasing Staking is the primary value accrual strategy of Standard. Stakers stake their SDA on the Standard website to earn [rebase ](https://docs.standarddao.finance/protocol/definitions#pol)rewards. The rebase rewards come from the proceed from swap sales, and can vary based on the number of SDA staked in the protocol and the reward rate set by monetary policy.

Staking is a passive, long-term strategy. The increase in your stake of SDA translates into a constantly falling cost basis converging on zero. This means even if the market price of SDA drops below your initial purchase price, given a long enough staking period, the increase in your staked SDA balance should eventually outpace the fall in price.

When you stake, you lock SDA and receive an equal amount of sSDA. Your sSDA balance rebases up automatically at the end of every epoch. sSDA is transferable and therefore composable with other DeFi protocols.

When you unstake, you burn sSDA and receive an equal amount of SDA. Unstaking means the user will forfeit the upcoming rebase reward. Note that the forfeited reward is only applicable to the unstaked amount; the remaining staked SDA (if any) will continue to receive rebase rewards.

## How Does the Treasury Grow?&#x20;

Growth of the treasury’s PCV is the primary drive for stakeholders in Standard. As the treasury grows in reserves and LPs, it increases the floor value of every SDA and also provides the opportunity to give off higher yields to stakers. More important though, growth of the treasury enables the protocol to increase its revenue from treasury assets alone and eventually provide a stabilized, fully backed yield. Standard’s treasury grows in a few ways:&#x20;

### Swaps&#x20;

Swaps give the Standard the ability to lock in assets to its treasury. Offering swaps in stable assets contribute to increasing the stable backing of the treasury. Swaps offered in other assets add to the total value of the treasury and also the ability for the treasury to earn its own yield through POL.&#x20;

### Liquidity Yields&#x20;

POL is one of the more useful types of assets held by the treasury since it is a mechanism to earn passive income through transaction fees. Owning the liquidity for SDA enables the Standard treasury to earn income for any transaction of the SDA token whether buying or selling. Eventually, Standard will own 100% of its liquidity earning all the fees much like a centralized exchange.&#x20;

### Staking Reserve Assets (DeFi)&#x20;

Reserve assets are single assets and do not earn passive yield like LPs. However, a variety of mechanisms may be employed in this case to put these assets to work as well, whether that be lending, validator staking (ETH 2.0), node staking (LINK superlinear staking TBD), or single asset staking on AMMs like Bancor. The benefit of building a treasury of Standard Digital Assets  is that these assets typically have the widest adoption across a variety of blockchains and good opportunities for secure yields.&#x20;
